# Sanrio Characters Mini Web App

This project was created as reference guide to view and learn more about Sanrio's most beloved characters.

## Data Sourcing

I used the Sanrio characters API created by dcstll on Github here: https://github.com/dcstll/apisanrio?tab=readme-ov-file#technologies
Additionally, I created my own JSON file and merged my added props together with the API's data.

## Technology
React JS
