# Sanrio Characters Mini Web App

This project was created as a reference guide to view and learn more about Sanrio's most beloved characters.

## Data Sourcing

I used the Sanrio characters API created by dcstll on Github here: https://github.com/dcstll/apisanrio?tab=readme-ov-file#technologies
Additionally, I created my own JSON file with additional props and merged this new data with the API's payload locally.

## Technology
React JS
